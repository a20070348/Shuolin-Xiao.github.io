__Biography__

I am Shuolin Xiao. I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Houston in 2020 and a B.A. in Electrical Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, China, in 2011. During my graduate studies, I developed numerical simulations for oil spills and wind turbine wake flows, with a primary objective of enhancing offshore environmental sustainability. After my Ph.D., I joined the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University as a Postdoctoral Associate. There, my research focused on the transport and fate of microplastics across urban, atmospheric, and oceanic environments. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Ralph S. Oâ€™Connor Sustainable Energy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, where I specialize in numerical simulations of wind farms using large-eddy simulation and machine learning technologies for analysis.

__Research Interests__

My research centers on improving the sustainability of the built environment, agriculture, and natural environment, approached from a fluid mechanics perspective and combined with interdisciplinary collaboration. In particular, I focus on emerging contaminants such as microplastics. The ubiquitous presence of microplastics, typically defined as plastics smaller than 5 mm in size, poses significant threats to the sustainability of aquatic and terrestrial environments and ecosystems. Their diverse range of sizes, shapes, and physical/chemical properties make the transport and fate of microplastics challenging to understand. This complexity increases when they become biofouled or aggregate with suspended sediment. My aim is to develop a physically-based approach to characterize, monitor, predict, and mitigate harmful contaminants, thereby protecting and sustaining our agriculture and natural resources. Additionally, I have a strong interest in renewable energy, especially wind energy. I seek to understand how knowledge from a fluid mechanics perspective can enhance the design and efficiency of both onshore and offshore wind farms. Furthermore, I am keen to investigate the impact of wind and solar farms on the built environment, agriculture, and natural surroundings, particularly when integrated with fishery and agricultural systems. This not only aims to improve efficiency but also to characterize and mitigate effects on wildlife.
