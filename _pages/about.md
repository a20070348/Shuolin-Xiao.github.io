__Biography__

I am Shuolin Xiao. I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Houston in 2020 and a B.A. in Electrical Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, China, in 2011. During my graduate studies, I developed numerical simulations for oil spills and wind turbine wake flows, with a primary objective of enhancing offshore environmental sustainability. After my Ph.D., I joined the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University as a Postdoctoral Associate. There, my research focused on the transport and fate of microplastics across urban, atmospheric, and oceanic environments. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Ralph S. O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, where I specialize in numerical simulations of wind farms using large-eddy simulation and machine learning technologies for analysis.

__Research Interests__

My research focuses on micrometeorological applications that leverage AI methodologies and digital twins to explore how micrometeorology interacts with man-made structures, such as agricultural facilities and renewable energy systems, facilitates the long-range transport of emerging contaminants, including microplastics and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and subsequently impacts local ecology and biodiversity under large-scale forcing, particularly during extreme weather events. Due to limited localized data availability for AI/ML training, a comprehensive repository must be developed, integrating data collected from high-fidelity simulations, sensors, and localized imaging. This repository is critical for developing low-cost, data-driven surrogate models. High-fidelity simulations combined with localized data are essential for understanding the underlying physics and informing data-driven models that incorporate sufficient physical and local details. Once these models are built, digital twins—virtual replicas of physical systems—can provide dynamic, interactive systems for monitoring, prediction, and decision-making by continuously updating the models with real-time data. Collectively, these advancements enhance our ability to understand and predict dynamic processes in micrometeorology, while also reducing operational and maintenance costs for man-made structures and agricultural facilities.

I am also deeply interested in renewable energy, with a particular focus on wind energy. This interest is twofold. Firstly, by leveraging insights from fluid mechanics, I aim to significantly enhance the design and efficiency of both onshore and offshore wind farms. It's crucial that we harness wind energy in the most effective manner possible, maximizing our energy yield. Secondly, and of equal importance, is the potential impact of these wind farms on our environment. While wind farms represent a cleaner energy alternative, they also introduce new dynamics into our ecological environment, agriculture, and wildlife. I'm dedicated to understanding these interactions. As we integrate renewable energy infrastructure with other systems, such as fisheries and agriculture, it's imperative to not only focus on efficiency but also to diligently work towards mitigating any adverse effects on wildlife and the broader environment. Ensuring a harmonious balance between our technological advancements and natural ecosystems is key to truly sustainable development.
